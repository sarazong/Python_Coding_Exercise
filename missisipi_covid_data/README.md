# Missisipi COVID Data Collection
For a COVID internship, I volunteered to collect COVID data released daily from public health departments in a collective effort to create a comprehensive COVID dataset covering the US. One of my assignments was to collect data from the state public health department of Missisipi. The COVID case count was released daily in a PDF. It contained information for each county cross tabulated by race and ethnicity. My goal was to record the case count by race and ethnicity separately. Initially, I did this manually everyday: reading the pdf and then worked on the arithmetics to get the numbers I need. That meant spending about an hour everyday on a repeativite task :unamused: a computer could do in a few seconds :smirk:. Eventually, I thought it would be a good idea to keep myself "DRY" from an hour of "sweat" daily by applying my python coding skill :grin:. The `collect_data_pdf.py` script was designed to read in a pdf file, just like **sep9_2020.pdf**, and returned two excel files containing the target COVID case information.
